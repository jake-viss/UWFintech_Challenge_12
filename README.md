# UWFintech_Challenge_12

## Description

A credit risk classification project in which I test two seperate models to determine which model more accurately catches high-risk loans in a dataset of lending information. The dataset contains imbalanced data (about 97% healthy loans versus 3% high-risk loans) so after modeling the dataset using the original training data I then use an oversampling technique in an attempt to create a more accurate model.  

To compare the two models results I use the accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report. Analyzing the most important metrics from these reports, the preicison and recall, I then make a recomendation in the attached Analysis report regarding which model to use.

## Technology
**Python 3.7**  
**Jupyter Lab**  
  
**Libraries**
+ Numpy
+ Pandas
+ Pathlib
+ Sklearn
+ Imblearn


## Usage
Review the Jupyter lab notebook titled "Credit_risk_resampling" to see the data preprocessing, model fitting, predictions, and results analysis.

Review the report titled, "Credit Risk Model Analysis", for the overview of both models and the recomendation of which model to use in the business situation.
